# SchoolAdministrativeSystem

<b>Description</b>:

Students of a school are divided into classes, usually one or more per grade level.

Each student studies a set of subjects, some common and some individually chosen. 

Students are then organized into groups where teachers hold lessons in those subjects. 

A group can contain more than one subject. 

In big schools with many students there can be multiple classes per grade level where as in smaller schools, 
a class might span over multiple grade levels.Groups may have both a minimum and a maximum number of students
that are required or allowed. 

If the capacity of a group is reached or number of required students isnâ€™t reached, those student are unplaced.
Students that are candidates for more than one group in a subject are left unplaced. The headmaster should be informed of
unplace students to be able to take further action. 


<b>Objective</b>:
Assess OO analysis, design, and Java programming skills. 


<b>The implementation</b>:

Primary features (must be implemented)
<p>
Data model of students, classes, subjects, and groups
<br>
Population of existing groups with students based on the subjects they are supposed to read and what classes they belong to. 
 <br>
The implementation must support both big and small schools, and everything in between. 
<p>
Secondary features (if time allows)
<br>
Support minimum and maximum number of students in a group
<br>
Report unplaced students
<p>

<b>Technology</b>:

Java 8+
Maven project
Unit tests (100% class coverage, >80% method coverage)
